I am an avid puzzle solver, my awe moment with coding and technology was a backtracking sudoku algorithm, a normal sudoku puzzle which takes me usually around 10 - 15 minutes to solve, is solved by the algorithm in mere 0.0013 ms, that peaked my interest in automating stuff using computers.

I have 3 years of work experience in BFSI (CITI BANK), Telecom (AT&T) domains in designing, developing and maintaining web applications.

I am well versed in technologies such as Java, Spring Framework, AWS, Azure, Angular, Node, Oracle SQL, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Bash Scripting etc.
