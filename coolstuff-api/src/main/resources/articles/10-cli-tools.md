ðŸ’» 10 Command-Line Utilities/Extensions I Love â€” You Will Too If You Try!

Terminal is where I find peace.

In a world full of cluttered GUIs and overwhelming information, the terminal stands out as an oasis of simplicity and control. If you know what youâ€™re doing, you can accomplish exactly what you needâ€”faster, more efficiently, and without ever touching the mouse. No more clicking endless iconsâ€”just you, your keyboard, and the screen.

Here are the 10 Tools I find useful in my day to day work as a software engineer.

zsh-autosuggestions
zsh-syntaxhighlight
zoxide
eza
fzf
code .
jq
rsync
open
find

1.  zsh-autosuggestions
    Faded suggestions for input commands from history.
    Possible IDE-like suggestions for the next option.

2.  zsh-syntaxhighlight
    Commands turn red if a wrong command is typed in the terminal. Instant feedback before hitting enter.

3.  zoxide
    Fuzzy directory jumping.
    Usual cd: /Users/vasi/projects/coding/bootstrap-styles
    With Zoxide: z coding styles

4.  eza
    Modern ls replacement with colors, tree view, icons, git integration, and human-readable sizes. Makes your ls commands vibrant and aesthetic.

5.  fzf
    Fuzzy Finder - Search, Navigate, files, dirs, command history.
    find . -type f | fzf --multi --preview '\''bat --style=numbers --color=always {}'\'' | xargs -n 1 code
    Letâ€™s you preview files from terminal and open them in vs-code on enter.
    Note: Needed packages - bat ( syntax high-lighted version of cat ) , code (vscode)

6.  code
    By having code command set in path, we can launch vs-code from terminal.
    Have diff comparisons or create a new VS Code window.

7.  jq
    Lightweight command-line tool for highlighting, processing, filtering json data from terminal.
    ![jq](./assets/images/10-cli-tools/1753546991945.png)

8.  rsync
    Copy doesnâ€™t show progress in macOS; with rsync, you can see the file copy progress. Also, rsync is a powerful alternative for fast, incremental file/directory synchronization.
    ![rsync](./assets/images/10-cli-tools/1753547021274.png)

9.  Open
    Powerful macOS utility that lets us open any file or folder or application straight from the terminal.
    ![Open](./assets/images/10-cli-tools/1753547075848.png)

10. Find
    You have SSHed into a server and forgot the path where a file resides. find comes to your rescue.
